# TakusMorphCatalog (Fork)
[WOW ADDON] An in-game model viewer for morphing

My fork work on WoW 8.3 (I didn't check on older or recent versions of the game)

Basically it's just an improvement of life:
* Close the window by pressing escape
* Morph and demorph buttons added on the morph window (with "add to favorite" and "copy id")
